# Java School

## Final task 3: Railway transport company

Project for Java School of the T-Systems company.
In which I had to implement a website so that clients can buy train tickets and so that workers can add train stations or see the passengers of each train,
among other functionalities.

### Funcionalidades

For company clients:
1. Searching for a train passing from station A to station B at a given time interval.
2. Train schedule for the station.
3. Buying a ticket if:
   3.1 There are free places.
   3.2 The passenger with the same name, surname and date of birth is not yet registered on the selected train.
   3.3 Before the departure of the train at least 10 minutes.
4. For company employees:
   4.1 adding new stations, trains.
   4.2 viewing all passengers registered for the train.
   4.3 viewing all trains.
